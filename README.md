# listsOf

This is a repository of lists for use in Moodle. Lists are tagged using {mlang} tags which can be filtered using the Multi-Language Content filters including the [Multi-lingual Content](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_multilangsecond) and [Multi-language Content v2](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_multilang2) plugins.

Naturally, feel free to use these lists for other purposes as well.
